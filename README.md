# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). The goal was to practice JavaScript basics, DOM manipulation, and event handling in a simple yet interactive application.

## How it works?
1. Player selects **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors** by clicking a button.
2. The computer randomly chooses its move.
3. The game compares the choices and displays the round result.
4. First to reach **5 points** wins the game.
5. A modal shows up to announce the winner and offers a restart button.
